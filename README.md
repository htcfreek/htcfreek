### At work 🛠💻
There I am doing all the stuff around Windows 10 deployment, GPOs and automated software deployment.

And the very important thing: I have to solve all the different problems that our users have with Windows and the software applications. (Okay, sometimes the things I did before are the reason. 😂)


### My free time activities 🏇🌳 
In my free time I currently contributing most to the [PowerToys repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys) and helping them by doing triage stuff and implementing features and fixes in PT Run. And If I am not doing something on my PC, then I am doing some sport or all the other stuff in my privat life.


### Programming knowledge 💡📄
I have good knowledge in PowerShell, AutoIT, AutoHotkey and Empirum script. Additional I can help a bit with SQL scripts and other scripting languages. (Reading a Script is for me like reading a book. 📖) And I have some basic C# knowledges.
